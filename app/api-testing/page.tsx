      title: "How does Keploy compare to traditional API testing tools?",
      answer:
        "Unlike tools like Karate & RestAssured, which require writing test cases manually, Keploy automatically generates test cases from real API traffic. It ensures zero manual effort, improves accuracy, and helps in mocking dependencies like databases and external APIs."
      },
    {
      title: "Can Keploy help in reducing bugs in production?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Keploy captures real user interactions with APIs and replays them in testing environments, ensuring that changes donâ€™t break existing functionality. This makes it great for catching regressions before they reach production."
      },
    {
      title: "How does Keploy handle complex API flows and dependencies?",
      answer:
        "Keploy records complex, distributed API flows and replays them as mocks and stubs during testing. This capability ensures that tests are realistic and can be executed without relying on external services or databases, simplifying the testing environment setup."
      },
    {
      title: "How does Keploy help in analyzing API test results?",
      answer:
        "Keploy provides comprehensive test reports, enabling developers to analyze test results quickly and identify areas for improvement."
